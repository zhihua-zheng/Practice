Python 3.x or Python 2.x
Homebrew provides one formula for Python 3.x (python) and another for Python 2.7.x (python@2).

The executables are organized as follows so that Python 2 and Python 3 can both be installed without conflict:

python3 points to Homebrew’s Python 3.x (if installed)
python2 points to Homebrew’s Python 2.7.x (if installed)
python points to Homebrew’s Python 2.7.x (if installed) otherwise the macOS system Python. Check out brew info python if you wish to add Homebrew’s 3.x python to your PATH.

pip3 points to Homebrew’s Python 3.x’s pip (if installed)
pip and pip2 point to Homebrew’s Python 2.7.x’s pip (if installed)
